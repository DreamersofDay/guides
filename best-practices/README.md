Best Practices
==============

A guide for programming well.

General
-------

* Don't duplicate the functionality of a built-in library.
* Don't swallow exceptions or "fail silently."
* Don't write code that guesses at future functionality.
* [Exceptions should be exceptional].
* [Keep the code simple].

Object-Oriented Design
----------------------

* Avoid global variables.
* Avoid long parameter lists.
* Limit collaborators of an object (entities an object depends on).
* Limit an object's dependencies (entities that depend on an object).
* Prefer composition over inheritance.
* Prefer small methods. Between one and five lines is best.
* Prefer small classes with a single, well-defined responsibility. When a
  class exceeds 100 lines, it may be doing too many things.
* [Tell, don't ask].

Ruby
----

* Avoid optional parameters. Does the method do too much?
* Use named parameters for 2 or more parameters.
* Avoid monkey-patching.

Ruby Gems
---------

* Declare dependencies in the `<PROJECT_NAME>.gemspec` file.
* Reference the `gemspec` in the `Gemfile`.
* Use [Bundler] to manage the gem's dependencies.
* Use [Circle CI] for Continuous Integration, indicators showing whether GitHub
  pull requests can be merged, and to test against multiple Ruby versions.

Rails
-----

* Avoid bypassing validations with methods like `save(validate: false)`,
  `update_attribute`, and `toggle`.
* Avoid using more than one model class in controllers
* Avoid naming methods after database columns in the same class.
* Don't change a migration after it has been merged into master if the desired
  change can be solved with another migration.
* Don't reference a model class directly from a view.
* Don't return false from `ActiveModel` callbacks, but instead raise an
  exception.
* Don't use instance variables in partials. Pass local variables to partials
  from view templates.
* Don't use SQL or SQL fragments (`where('inviter_id IS NOT NULL')`) outside of
  models.
* Generate necessary [Spring binstubs] for the project, such as `rake` and
  `rspec`, and add them to version control.
* If there are default values, set them in migrations.
* Keep `db/schema.rb` or `db/development_structure.sql` under version control.
* Use only one instance variable in each view.
* Use `_url` suffixes for named routes in mailer views and [redirects].  Use
  `_path` suffixes for named routes everywhere else.
* Validate the associated `belongs_to` object (`user`), not the database column
  (`user_id`).
* Use `db/seeds.rb` for data that is required in all environments.
* Use `dev:prime` rake task for development environment seed data.
* Prefer `cookies.signed` over `cookies` to [prevent tampering].

Testing
-------

* Avoid `any_instance` in rspec-mocks and mocha. Prefer [dependency injection].
* Avoid `let!` in RSpec.
* Avoid using instance variables in tests.
* Disable real HTTP requests to external services with
  `WebMock.disable_net_connect!`.
* Don't test private methods.
* Test background jobs with a [`Delayed::Job` matcher].
* Use named `subject` in RSpec.
* Use [stubs and spies] \(not mocks\) in isolated tests.
* Use a single level of abstraction within scenarios.
* Use an `it` example or test method for each execution path through the method.
* Use [assertions about state] for incoming messages.
* Use stubs and spies to assert you sent outgoing messages.
* Use a [Fake] to stub requests to external services.
* Use integration tests to execute the entire app.
* Use non-[SUT] methods in expectations when possible.
* Add at least one acceptance test with Capybara following the happy path
  for every feature that adds or changes something in the UI.

Bundler
-------

* Specify the [Ruby version] to be used on the project in the `Gemfile`.
* Use versionless `Gemfile` declarations for gems that have no know breaking changes in the latest version.
* Use exact versions in the `Gemfile` for fragile gems, such as Rails.

[Ruby version]: http://bundler.io/v1.3/gemfile_ruby.html

Postgres
--------

* Avoid multicolumn indexes in Postgres. It [combines multiple indexes]
  efficiently. Optimize later with a [compound index] if needed.
* Consider a [partial index] for queries on booleans.
* [Index foreign keys].

Background Jobs
---------------

* Store IDs, not `ActiveRecord` objects for cleaner serialization, then re-find
  the `ActiveRecord` object in the `perform` method.

Email
-----

* Use a tool like [MailTrap] to look at each created or updated mailer view
  before merging.

JavaScript
----------

* Use CoffeeScript.

HTML
----

* Don't use a reset button for forms.

CSS
---

* Use Sass.

Sass
----

* Use `image-url` and `font-url`, not `url`, so the asset pipeline will re-write
  the correct paths to assets.

Browsers
--------

* Don't support clients without Javascript.
* Don't support IE6 or IE7.
